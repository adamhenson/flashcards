Diffusion (dih-FYOO-zhun) – noun
  A generative process that transforms noise into structured data through gradual refinement.
  a) The diffusion model can generate photorealistic images from pure static.

Vector Database (VEK-tor day-tuh-bays) – noun
  A specialized database optimized for storing and querying embeddings.
  a) We use a vector database to power semantic search.
  b) It’s wild that search now works more like memory than indexing.

Zero-shot (ZEER-oh-shot) – adjective
  Describing a model’s ability to perform a task without explicit training examples.
  a) The model solved the problem zero-shot—it just generalized.
  b) He tried cooking zero-shot with no recipe and lived to tell the tale.

Few-shot (FYOO-shot) – adjective
  Using only a few examples to teach or adapt a model.
  a) Few-shot learning is surprisingly close to how people learn new slang.
  b) We did a few-shot demo, and it nailed the pattern instantly.

Overfitting (oh-ver-FIT-ing) – noun
  When a model learns noise or specifics too well, performing poorly on new data.
  a) The classifier overfits after ten epochs—classic sign we need dropout.
  b) He’s overfitting his jokes to one friend group.

Regularization (reg-yuh-lur-uh-ZAY-shun) – noun
  A technique to prevent overfitting by adding constraints or penalties.
  a) Regularization helps keep the model general instead of memorizing.
  b) I could use some regularization on my spending habits.

Inference (IN-fur-uhns) – noun
  The process of running a trained model to generate predictions or outputs.
  a) Latency during inference is our biggest bottleneck right now.
  b) He’s doing human-level inference on my tone again.

Gradient Descent (GRAY-dee-ent dih-SENT) – noun
  An optimization algorithm that minimizes errors by adjusting weights step-by-step.
  a) The model learns through gradient descent—tiny steps toward less dumb.
  b) My mornings are basically gradient descent toward being awake.

Backpropagation (bak-pro-puh-GAY-shun) – noun
  The process of updating neural network weights by propagating errors backward.
  a) Backpropagation is what lets deep learning actually “learn.”
  b) I wish I had backpropagation for my bad decisions.

Attention Mechanism (uh-TEN-shun MEK-uh-niz-um) – noun
  A component that allows models to focus on relevant parts of input data.
  a) The attention mechanism is why transformers outperform older models.
  b) Her attention mechanism shuts down after 3 p.m.

Transformer (trans-FOR-mer) – noun
  A neural network architecture that uses attention to process sequences efficiently.
  a) The transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing.
  b) Every startup now claims they’re “built on transformers,” like it’s a religion.

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) (LOH-rah) – noun
  A fine-tuning method that adapts large models efficiently by training fewer parameters.
  a) We used LoRA to fine-tune the model without breaking the GPU budget.
  b) LoRA is like teaching the model new tricks without full retraining.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ri-TREE-vul og-men-tid jen-uh-RAY-shun) – noun
  A method where the model pulls external data before generating a response.
  a) We use RAG to keep answers grounded in real facts.
  b) It’s like the model Googles before it speaks—retrieval-augmented generation at work.
