        "**Impact**: Built a CI reliability dashboard that visualized flaky backend tests, helping reduce release-blocking failures by ~35%.",
        "**Situation**: Frequent intermittent test failures were delaying major releases while my manager was out.",
        "**Action**: Volunteered to triage failures, traced root causes, and built a weekend prototype using Node.js that parsed JUnit XMLs and stored results as JSON artifacts surfaced in GitLab CI.",
        "**Result**: Leadership praised the initiative (internal 'Cheers for Peers'). Release stability improved immediately, and the dashboard became a template for other teams.",

        "**Situation**: Rapid release growth caused frequent production regressions and low test confidence.",
        "**Action**: Authored proposal and 3-phase plan (POC → rollout → evangelize). Built framework around Playwright + internal ClaimBot tool, implemented in CI, demoed to all EMs. Created documentation and Slack alerts for visibility.",
        "**Result**: Organization-wide adoption; teams began writing tests autonomously. Incident rate dropped significantly.",

        "**Situation**: Tasked to prototype an in-browser solution that would guide users to take properly framed vehicle photos for damage assessment. Requirements were vague, timelines aggressive, and design, QA, and engineering ran in parallel.",
        "**Action**: Built the experience end-to-end—from rapid Storybook prototyping to production rollout. Implemented live ML object detection using TensorFlow running in the browser; streamed webcam input to a `<canvas>` via `requestAnimationFrame`, overlaying dynamic visual feedback when framing matched SVG-defined boundaries. Added resilient background uploads, offline support with IndexedDB, and debounced detection loops to maintain frame-rate stability.",
        "**Result**: Delivered MVP ahead of deadline. The system handled high daily traffic with <2% failure rate and became a key differentiator cited in enterprise demos. The success accelerated a large-scale client deal and strengthened the company’s competitive positioning.",
        "**Takeaway**: Even with ambiguous requirements and severe time pressure, combining creative prototyping, disciplined iteration, and tight cross-team collaboration can produce breakthrough results."
